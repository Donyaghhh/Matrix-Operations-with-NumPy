# Matrix-Operations-with-NumPy
This project demonstrates fundamental matrix operations implemented in Python using the NumPy library. It includes basic arithmetic operations and a manual implementation of 2D convolution, showing how these mathematical concepts can be coded efficiently.


Features

Matrix Addition: Element-wise addition of two matrices.

Matrix Subtraction: Element-wise subtraction of two matrices.

Matrix Multiplication: Matrix product using the @ operator (dot product).

2D Convolution: Custom convolution implementation without using external libraries (like OpenCV or SciPy).
